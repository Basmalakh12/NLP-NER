# NLP-NER
Named Entity Recognition (NER)
is a branch of Natural Language Processing (NLP) involved in identifying and classifying named entities within text. These entities can be people, locations, organizations, dates, times, quantities, percentages, monetary values, and more.

Think of it as highlighting the important bits of information in text, allowing computers to understand and process it more effectively.

Here's an example:

Sentence: "The Queen of England, Elizabeth II, visited the United States last week."

NER would identify and classify:

Person: Elizabeth II 
Title: Queen 
Location: England, United States 
Date: last week
