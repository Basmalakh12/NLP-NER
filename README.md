# NLP-NER
Named Entity Recognition (NER)
 is a branch of Natural Language Processing (NLP) involved in identifying and classifying named entities within text. These entities can be people, locations, organizations, dates, times, quantities, percentages, monetary values, and more.

Think of it as highlighting the important bits of information in text, allowing computers to understand and process it more effectively.

Here's an example:

Sentence: "The Queen of England, Elizabeth II, visited the United States last week."

NER would identify and classify:

Person: Elizabeth II
Title: Queen
Location: England, United States
Date: last week
NER has various applications, including:

Information extraction: Extracting structured data from text for further analysis.
Question answering: Identifying relevant information to answer questions about text.
Machine translation: Translating named entities accurately.
Text summarization: Identifying key information for summaries.
Sentiment analysis: Analyzing the sentiment of text based on entities.
